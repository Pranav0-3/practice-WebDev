                It is a productivity method developed by Brian Tracy and described in his book Eat That Frog!:
                <br /> 21 Great Ways to Stop Procrastinating and Get More Done in Less Time. Both the book and the method get their names from a quote usually attributed to Mark Twain (though whether Twain actually said/wrote it has been debated): "Eat a live frog first thing in the morning and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day."
                <br /> <br />
                Applied to work, Tracy says that your "frog" is the most important and most impactful task you have to complete. If you eat the frog (i.e., work on it) first thing every morning, you'll be more productive and successful, and you'll reach your goals more quickly.
                <br /> <br />
                And while Eat That Frog is best-known for its namesake advice, the book itself contains 21 different principles people can follow to boost their productivity. It's a digest of productivity techniquesâ€”bringing together practices like time-blocking, the Pareto principle, and prioritizing tasksâ€”that, when combined, all work to support the core Eat That Frog productivity method.
                <br /> <br />
                Tracy presents some actionable advice for each principle in his book, but he typically recommends a single approach to executing on each principle. Of course, productivity is highly personal: What works for one person may not work for someone else. So in addition to presenting Tracy's ideas and recommendations below, we've linked to several Zapier resources that include additional information and alternative approaches so you can get to know the science behind certain principles and easily find an approach that feels right for you.

            <h2>The 21 Principles of the Eat That Frog Productivity Method</h2>
            <p>
                While the core methodology of Eat That Frog sounds simple, it actually requires you to conduct a series of activities and develop several habits before you can succeed with the approach
                <br /> <br />
                In his book, Tracy describes each of those activities and habits as the 21 core principles of the Eat That Frog method. Some of the principles are things you need to do before you start using the method. Others are things you need to keep in mind as you practice the method to ensure you're always prioritizing your frogs. So it's best to familiarize yourself with all of the principles before you get started.
                <br /> <br />
                Below are summaries of each of Tracy's 21 principles, along with links to Zapier resources that will help you learn more about the research supporting each principle, find alternatives to the specific methods and activities Tracy recommends, and discover some tools that may help you streamline your new approach to managing your tasks and schedule.

                    <p>Tracy says that lack of clarity is one of the biggest causes of waste and procrastination. If you don't know exactly what your goals areâ€”what you're striving to achieveâ€”it's unlikely that you'll be able to identify and prioritize the specific tasks you need to work on to achieve those goals.
                        <br /><br />
                        Consider what you want to achieve personally, or work with your boss to define your major work goals. Then, write your goals down so that you can refer back to them frequently. "A goal or objective that is not in writing is merely a wish or fantasy," Tracy says. "Unwritten goals lead to confusion, vagueness, misdirection, and numerous mistakes."
                        <br /><br />            
                        Once you've documented your goals, set a deadline for when you want to achieve them, break them down into every task that needs to be done in order for you to achieve those goals, and resolve to work on one goal task every single day.
                        <br /><br />
                        Your goal tasks are your frogsâ€”the things you want to work on first thing every day for greater productivity and success.</p>
